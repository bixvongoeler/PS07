### About Me
Hi, I'm Bix. I am currently a Student at Northampton High School. I have some basic knowledge of both R studio, and Python. 


### Heres a ggplot!

This maps the pressure of some space, based off of the temperature of that space

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pressure, mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "black")
```
